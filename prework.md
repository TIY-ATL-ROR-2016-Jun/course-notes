# The Iron Yard Backend Engineering Prework
## Atlanta Q2 2016: Jun 06 - Aug 26

_Brit Butler (brit@theironyard.com)_

We've got
[a lot](https://dgosxlrnzhofi.cloudfront.net/custom_page_images/64/page_images/Rails_Competencies.png?1386276348)
to cover and precious little time to cover it in. You need to complete
some preliminary work so we can have a common starting point and hit
the ground running.

These assignments will make sure that you've got basic familiarity 
with some key concepts so you aren't lost right out of the gate.

Importantly, this work will assure me that you:

1. can self-direct progress on technical projects
2. have been exposed to major technologies we'll be using in class
3. can communicate struggles and accomplishments clearly
4. have reflected on your learning style

*Note*: Point 2 is not "have internalized every detail", but I will
expect you to at least be _familiar_ with e.g. `git` and the terminal.

## Requirements

Review and complete the tasks below by **Jun 01**. Any
deliverables should be emailed to me by then. If you have any
questions, *please email me*, I'd love to help!
(Expect a little good-natured shaming if it's 24 hours before the deadline.)

You will need to sign up for Treehouse to complete some of these
tasks. Treehouse is free for 14 days (which should be more than enough
to finish the required work), and $25/month after the trial.

## Tasks

* OS Upgrade
* Text Editing
* The Command Line
* Version Control
* Programming

### OS Upgrade

Install the free OSX El Capitan upgrade from the App Store.

### Text Editing

#### Pick and Install a text editor.

However mundane it may sound, a text editor is one of the most important
tools in a developer's life. I believe that big internet fights about which
text editor is _"best"_ are pointless but picking and becoming familiar with
**some text editor** is essential. I'd recommend:

* Sublime Text 3
  * Pros: Friendly UI, Snappy, good plugin ecosystem.
  * Cons: Non-free but demo only nags to upgrade
* Atom
  * Pros: Similar to Sublime but free, very actively developed.
  * Cons: Can be slow on older computers.

I'm an Emacs user myself, but don't recommend it for the class
(distracts too much from learning to code). Grabbing SublimeText
or Atom should be great assuming you don't already have an editor you like.

#### Type some code!

Typing code is very different than typing documents or emails.
A **lot** of time in the first weeks of programming
is spent fixing simple typing errors. Practicing *typing*
code has the added benefit of familiarizing you with Ruby syntax.

Work through a few Rails lessons on [Typing.io](http://typing.io).
Getting some practice in could save you a lot of time the first few weeks of class.

### The Command Line

#### Basic CLI Usage

The command line will be our primary interface to the computer, and
aside from your editor, the place you will spend the most time. If you've
never opened up a terminal before, now is the time to get comfortable.

* (Optional) Install and use iTerm2 as your terminal
* Go through the Treehouse course on
  [Getting Started with the Console](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console)
* Read and practice with
  [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)

### Version Control

#### Git

Git is an open source version control tool. When you're working on
with a team of 5 on a 20,000 line Rails project, it's crucial to track
the different changes to the code being made over time. Any programming
job worth having will use git or a similar tool for collaboration.

Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but
just to start to get comfortable with the concepts and
vocabulary. We'll continue to work with Git throughout the course and
cover some of the more advanced concerns in class.

1. Go through the Treehouse course on [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics)
2. (Optional) If you want to spend some more time with git,
   [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a great resource.

## GitHub

GitHub is a web-based hosting and code sharing network for software developers. Think of it like Facebook for programmers.

Linus Torvalds created this really cool command line tool for managing code called `git` and the next thing you know, everybody was using it.

Then some folks in Silicon Valley were like "What if we made a really cool social network to make it easier for all the folks using git to collaborate with others and manage their projects?" and the next thing you know Github was born.

1. Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com)
2. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name and email.
3. Complete some basic [git exercises](https://try.github.io)
4. Send an email to `brit@theironyard.com` with your github username so I can add you to the course organization!

### Programming

#### Ruby

We'll cover Ruby from square one in class but at breakneck speed.
Most of the concepts will take repeated exposure before sinking in.
So, you *really* don't want your first exposure to be in lecture.

1. Start the
   [Codecademy Ruby course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby). Work
   through at least "Arrays & Hashes", but feel free to go farther if
   you'd like.
2. (Optional) Sign up for [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io) or
   [RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com) with your new Github account. Work
   through the ruby exercises as best as you can. The important thing
   here isn't to complete everything but to get some practice writing ruby.

## Some Final Notes

I'm looking forward to working with you this cohort. I'd like to
spend just a moment talking about the right mindset for taking the course.

The Iron Yard, if given your full attention and commitment, will
be both incredibly hard and transformative. But for these 12 short weeks,
we're all in it together. Our goal as a class should be to make each
other better and give freely of our knowledge to help others succeed.

The tech industry is a breeding ground for impostor syndrome. My first
priority is establishing a tone and environment where we can pursue
personal improvement confidently. Ashley Nelson-Hornstein recently
wrote a brilliant piece [about what that means](http://ashleynh.me/on-confidence/)
that I discovered from [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/726201450079113216).

Please reflect on the following quote:

> Confident tech workers have an inner belief that they can learn, grow, and understand technical concepts.
> As a result, they approach difficult problems as a positive learning experience - regardless of outcome.
> Because they are secure in their abilities, confident tech workers don't worry about the optics of looking bad
> when they're wrong - so they readily admit mistakes. Being secure makes them unafraid to ask for help when needed.
> And when they do ask for help, confident tech workers expect to understand the explanation provided.
> In fact, they'll continue asking questions until they receive an explanation that makes sense to them.

Failure and struggle is a crucial part of growth of any kind.
I want our classroom to be a safe space to struggle above all else.
Persistent struggle and growth can be exhausting but it should be
rewarding and I'm going to do my best to make sure we have some fun.
I hope you're as excited as I am. Rest up, our adventure begins soon.
